Convert Balsamiq mockups into HTML and CSS code automatically with Deep learning

This is a project done in a Master Thesis at University of Minho. The initial objective was to convert hand-drawn sketches into HTML and CSS code. Due to lack of datasets I used an online framework Balsamiq mockups to create the mockups.
A Deep Learning model (developed in Keras) learns to convert the mockups into code automatically.

 Uses a lot of technology to work properly:

* [ReactJS] - Frontend
* [Python] - Create the server
* [Keras] - Development the Deep Learning model
* [Balsamiq mockups] - Create the mockups
* [HTML, CSS and Bootstrap] - Code generated by DL model
* [Github] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Nginx and apache server] - 

# Soon available code
